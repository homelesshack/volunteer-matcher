# YOUR GRIDS, HOWEVER YOU WANT THEM
Gridset gives you your grids in a multitude of different formats to fit into your workflow however you want.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Your Gridset assets
In this grid package are:
1. PNGs of all your grids
2. A grid overlay Javascript file
3. CSS for Rapid Prototyping and Production
4. Sass Functions and Mixins for Custom CSS
5. A demo HTML file to see how Gridset output can be applied

### PNGs for Raster Output
Do you use Photoshop or Fireworks for your design work? No problem. For every grid in your grid set we provide a PNG for you to drop into your graphics editor of choice. 

### Grid Overlay script
For helping you design to your grid in the browser, we’ve included a useful little script that toggles on and off your grids. Just include it at the bottom of your HTML file and append your URL with "?gridset=show" to permanently show the grid, or use Cmd + G on a Mac or Ctrl + G in Windows to toggle it on and off. The overlay will work on all grids within your set providing accurate guides to work with.

### CSS for Rapid Prototyping and Production
Gridset generates all the CSS you could need, with every measurement and class ready to go. You will receive a folder with the CSS files and an .htaccess file that will compress and serve your CSS on the fly using gzip. If you have grids for more than one screen size, you’ll also find a gridset-ie-lte8.css file for use with Internet Explorer 8 and below, since these browsers do not support media queries. If you are using grids with 12 or more columns, you may also see a gridset-ie-9.css file.

### Sass Functions and Mixins for Custom CSS
In the Sass folder, you will find a Sass file full of easy-to-use functions & mixins, allowing you to quickly write custom layout CSS without needing to add any Gridset classes to your semantic HTML.

### DEMO.HTML
This is a simple HTML file showing how your Gridset CSS can be linked to your resources and applied to HTML elements.
